% The m-files of the MSS (Marine Systems Simulator) toolbox are fully 
% compatible with MATLAB (www.mathworks.com) and the free software 
% GNU Octave (www.octave.org), facilitating broad accessibility and 
% application in marine systems simulation. It includes models for ships, 
% underwater vehicles, uncrewed surface vehicles, and floating structures. 
% The library also contains guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) blocks 
% for real-time simulation. 
% 
% To begin using the MSS toolbox, ensure it is installed and properly set 
% up in your MATLAB/Octave environment. Copy the directory MSS/... to your 
% computer and "add the path with subfolders" to Matlab/Octave.
