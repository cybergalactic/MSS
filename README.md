# MSS (Marine Systems Simulator)

The Marine Systems Simulator (MSS) is a Matlab/Simulink library for marine systems. It includes models for ships, underwater vehicles, and floating structures. The library also contains guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) blocks for real-time simulation. Please include the following reference when you use the GNC and HYDRO toolboxes:

Copy the folder /MSS to your Matlab folder and "add the path with subfolders" to Matlab. Then type:

    help MSS

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 GNC Toolbox
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Basic libraries and system examples for guidance, navigation and control (GNC). The library contains:

- M-file functions (kinematics and kinetics) and Simulink examples for time-domain GNC applications.
- M-file library with vessels models, maneuvering trials, and dynamic simulation.
- User editable m-files for simulation and control of ships, rigs and underwater vehicles.
- Simulink toolbox for dynamic simulation of marine vessels and control systems. The Simulink library includes vessels models, autopilots, DP control systems, wave filters, guidance systems, actuator models and much more.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 HYDRO Toolbox
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The toolbox reads output data files generated by hydrodynamic programs and processes the data for use in Matlab/Simulink. MSS Hydro includes several example vessels. In order to build your own model, you need a license for one of the following programs:

- 2D strip theory programs - ShipX (Veres) by SINTEF OCEAN AS
- 3D potential theory programs - WAMIT by WAMIT Inc.

The processed data can be used in real-time simulation of marine vessels in 6 DOF exposed to 1st- and 2nd-order wave loads (motion and force RAO transfer functions).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
FDI Toolbox
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a stand-alone toolbox for identification of radiation-force models and fluid memory effects of marine structures such as marine craft and wave energy converters. Please include the following reference when you use the MSS FDI toolbox:
